### ❖ What Is This?

**Cursed Pet Simulator** is a frontend-only, Tamagotchi-inspired web experience where you care for  
**Spuddy** — a sentient potato that is far too emotionally aware for what it is.

You feed it.
It reacts.
It judges you.
Sometimes it becomes enlightened for no reason.

There are stats, but they don’t matter.  
There is care, but it might not help.

This project exists purely for **absurd joy**, **existential humor**, and **vibe coding**.

  - Pixel-art potato with expressive emotions
  - Idle animations: blinking, twitching, sighing
  - Maintains unsettling eye contact at all times

- 🍽️ **Cursed Feeding System**
  Feed Spuddy things it was never meant to consume:
  - Office & Tech artifacts (WiFi signals, dead USBs)
  - Abstract concepts (regret, impostor syndrome, hope)
  - Cursed foods (haunted beans, suspicious cheese)
  - Nostalgic relics (dial-up sounds, AOL CDs)

- 💬 **Chaotic Emotional Reactions**
  - Dramatic text responses
  - Expression and color changes
  - Screen shake, glitch flashes, and general unease

- 📊 **Fake Stats That Judge You**
  - Existential Dread (always high)
  - Spud Energy (unpredictable)
  - Enlightenment (random, suspicious)
  - Suspicion Level (you are not trusted)

- 🖥️ **Optional Screensaver Mode**
  Spuddy drifts aimlessly. You observe. Nothing improves.

### ❖ Philosophy

This is not a productivity app.
This is not a serious game.
This is not here to optimize your life.

**It exists because:**
- Not everything needs a purpose
- Retro web games had soul
- Potatoes deserve representation

If it feels pointless, it’s working.

Spuddy will still judge you.
